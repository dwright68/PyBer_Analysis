# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to anyalyze revenue trends across three different types of areas that PyBer services. These are rural, suburban and urban areas. Using the below graphs we will be able to identify trends over the course of the past few months, and identify potential ways to increase revenue. 

## City Type Comparison

Using the above datafram we can see the following information. 
 - Rural areas see the least amount of drivers and the least amount of rides, but the highest average fares. 
 - Urban areas easily have the highest amount of driver, but the lowest average faires. 
 - Suburban neighborhoods remain firmly in the middle. Driving a moderate amonut of rides and fares. 

### Further Comparisons 
Below we will zoom in somewhat on the total rides, drivers, and fares on each city type. See images below.

As we can see above nearly everything is heavily skewed towards urban areas. This is to be expected due to the huge population differences and lower likelyhood of vehicle ownership in urban areas.

##Fares Over Time

Above we can see of timeline of total fares between the months of January and April. While urban areas dominate the amount of fares we can see that demand based on the time of year is the similar across the board relative to the total volume that each type of city has. 

## Business Recommendations
Based off the above information I have the below recomendations:
 - Decrease the rates charged in rural areas. This can potentially drive the volume of riders up and provide more revenue overall. 
 - In the short term increase rates in urban areas. This way we can see more revenue from shorter trips and use this to more than cover the temporary loss from lowering the cost in rual areas. 
 - Adjust rates based off of peak travel times. This will mainly impact urban and suburban areas and further subsidize the cost of lowering rates in rural areas and ultimately drive more revenue.
